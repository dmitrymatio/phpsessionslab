/* come to this page from private at 9:30:00

that's ok, user was inactive for 9 seconds

but
come to this page from private at 9:30:11... that's too much inactivity time
 (more than 10 seconds): kill the session (e.g. redirect to logout.php)

also should also display
// shows: logged in as:
//Tam for: 1h 02m 44s


//come to this page at feb 8 9:29:00
